Video Watermarking Script (Python + MoviePy)
description: >
  This Python script automates video processing by resizing videos, overlaying a transparent watermark,
  and saving the output without audio. It randomly selects a watermark from a folder, ensuring variation 
  in processed videos.

features:
  - Batch processing: Scans a folder and processes multiple videos at once.
  - Video resizing: Converts all videos to 720x1280 px (portrait format).
  - Random watermark selection: Picks a random .png watermark from the "watermark" folder.
  - Watermark resizing: Resizes the watermark to 720x1280 px to fully cover the video.
  - Audio removal: Outputs final videos without audio.
  - Automatic folder management: Saves processed videos in a "ready" folder.

usage:
  steps:
    - Place your videos inside the "videos" folder.
